## Portfolio

I was always interested in Cuber security. Even though for now I know nothing about how to work with security, I am eager to study. I believe hard work pays off, so I am ready to put efford in it. My next five year plan is to make through this 2020, then graduate college and get a internship, then get a job in my field and become one of those experts who make good money.
